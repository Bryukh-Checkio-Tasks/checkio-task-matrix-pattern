    For the exploring Sophia use drones. But she tired to look at the monitors all the time.
    Sophia wants to learn the drones recognize some basis patterns and mark it.
</p>
<p>
    The drones have a simple optical monochrome system. So the image can be represented as a binary matrix.
    You should to write a program to search a binary matrix (a pattern) in a other binary matrix (an image).
    The recognition process consists in scanning row by row (horizontal scanning) the image matrix,
    when a pattern is located on the image you must mark this pattern.
    To mark a located pattern change 1 to 3 and 0 to 2.
    The result will be the image matrix with the located patterns marked.
</p>

<p>
    The patterns in the image matrix are not crossed, because you should mark the pattern right away when it is located.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
    <img class="for_info_only" title="pattern" src="{{MEDIA}}pattern.png" alt="pattern" width="360px"/>
    <img class="for_editor_only" title="pattern" src="{{MEDIA}}pattern.png" alt="pattern" width="360px"/>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Two arguments. A pattern as a binary matrix, a list of lists. A image as a binary matrix, a list of lists.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The marked image as a matrix, a list of list.
