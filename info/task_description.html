    To explore new islands and areas Sophia uses drones. But she gets tired looking at the monitors all the time.
    Sophia wants to learn the drones to recognize some basis patterns and mark them.
</p>
<p>
    The drones have a simple optical monochrome system, an image can be represented as a binary matrix.
    You should write a program to search a binary matrix (a pattern) in an other binary matrix (an image).
    The recognition process consists of scanning the image matrix row by row (horizontal scanning), and
    when a pattern is located on the image, the program must mark this pattern as such.
    To mark a located pattern change 1 to 3 and 0 to 2.
    The result will be the image matrix with the located patterns marked.
</p>

<p>
    The patterns in the image matrix are not crossed, because you should mark the pattern right away when it is located.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
    <img class="for_info_only" title="pattern" src="{{MEDIA}}pattern.png" alt="pattern" width="455px"/>
    <img class="for_editor_only" title="pattern" src="{{MEDIA}}pattern.png" alt="pattern" width="380px"/>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Two arguments. A pattern as a binary matrix, a list of lists. An image as a binary matrix, a list of lists.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The marked image as a matrix, a list of list.

        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: python">
checkio([[1, 0], [1, 1]],
        [[0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
         [0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
         [1, 0, 1, 1, 0],
         [1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
         [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]]) == [[0, 3, 2, 1, 0],
                               [0, 3, 3, 0, 0],
                               [3, 2, 1, 3, 2],
                               [3, 3, 0, 3, 3],
                               [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]]
checkio([[1, 1], [1, 1]],
        [[1, 1, 1],
         [1, 1, 1],
         [1, 1, 1]]) == [[3, 3, 1],
                         [3, 3, 1],
                         [1, 1, 1]]
    </pre>

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    As we can see in the first chapter, this task is a simple monochrome pattern recognition.
